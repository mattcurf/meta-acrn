SUMMARY = " A Type 1 reference hypervisor stack, running directly on the bare-metal hardware"
DESCRIPTION = "The open source project ACRN defines a device hypervisor reference stack \
and an architecture for running multiple software subsystems, managed \
securely, on a consolidated system by means of a virtual machine \
manager. It also defines a reference framework implementation for \
virtual device emulation, called the "ACRN Device Model"."
